The scheme we present allows for tracking of unknown rotationally symmetric objects and is based on a robust technique for estimating the axis of these objects adapted from a previous work. Adittionally we use template matching to track previously known objects. For grasping a trajectory is planned for the gripper that chases the object and is able to synchronize to the object{\rq}s motion, allowing to lift the object from the conveyor.},

Many existing machine tools, handling and logistics systems are already generic and not bound to a specific product a-priori. Yet this flexibility and reconfigurability on the asset level is lost in automated systems that are limited to executing a small set of predefined actions in a fixed sequence. The SkillPro\footnote{Skill-based Propagation of Plug'n'Produce-Devices in Reconfigurable Production Systems by AML; The project SkillPro (Grant 314247) has received funding from the European Union{\rq}s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no ICT-287733.} project aims to develop a holistic service-oriented framework for modelling and orchestration of modern adaptable manufacturing systems. The core concept is a unified abstraction for manufacturing tasks: skills provided by the available assets and the requirements of the different production steps. The skill-based system model enables the transition from generic high-level descriptions to low-level formats that can be directly executed. Self-describing assets can be added, changed and removed at runtime, taking into account technical and economic conditions to best achieve the manufacturing goals.},

Many existing machine tools, handling and logistics systems provide a generic functionality that is not bound to a specific product.

	abstract = {Many manipulation applications in industrial settings using robots depend on reliable detection and grasping capabilities of stationary or moving objects. The latter demand an extended use of intrinsic and extrinsic sensors being in a closed control-loop with a robotic system. In this paper we present an approach for tracking, reconstruction and grasping of unknown objects from a moving conveyor belt using an external depth sensor and an industrial robot. The approach consists of an algorithm for the estimation of the position, velocity and form of an object, an algorithm for estimation of the conveyor's path and an algorithm for calculating an interception trajectory for the robot. The presented scheme is designed for tracking and reconstruction of unknown rotationally symmetrical objects. Nevertheless, the reconstruction algorithm is able to detect asymmetrical parts of an object and recognize if an object is hollow. This is further used for calculation of a feasible grasp. From the reconstruction data a mesh of the object is created. Finally, robots interception and grasping trajectory are calculated on-line for any arbitrary position on the conveyor. The objects are sucessfully grasped from moving conveyor up to the speed of more than 10 [cm/s].},
