abstract = {In Germany, only approximately 30{\%} by mass of plastics from lightweight packaging waste is recycled; 65{\%} by mass is transferred to inferior residual fractions (sorting residue and mixed plastics), which are currently only utilized thermally. An increase in the recycling of valuable resources in the sense of material recycling would both contribute to the saving of resources and improve the economic situation of plant operators. It is generally known from operating and planning experience that fluctuation in the amount of material loaded into the sorting process is one of the main reasons for suboptimal recycling quotas. In particular, overfilling in the input stream leads to a deterioration of the separation result of the entire process. A novel process control concept envisages equalizing the material flow in such a way that all separation steps are operated in the intended design range. For the example of a lightweight packaging treatment process, the requirements and technological solutions for a sensor-based process control concept will be presented.},

@article{Kuppers2020,
abstract = {According to the Directive (EU) 2018/851 of the European Union, higher recycling rates for municipal waste will have to be met in the near future. Beside improvements to the collection systems, the efficiency of mechanical processing and sorting will have to be increased to reach the EU´s targets. Sensor-based sorting (SBS) plants constitute an integral part of today's sorting processes. Two main factors determine the sorting performance: throughput rate and input composition. To improve recycling efficiencies, especially SBS machines need to be optimized. Three evaluation criteria are used to describe the performance of these processes: recovery (content of input material – both eject and reject material discharged into the product frac-tion) or product quantity (amount of product generated via sorting within a specific interval – calculated by multiplying throughput rate and yield), yield (amount of eject material discharged into the product fraction), and product purity. For this study, 160 sorting experiments each with 1,000 red and white low-density polyethylene (LDPE) chips were conducted to investigate the effects of throughput rate and input composition on sorting processes. This simplified approach reduced the influence of other factors on the sorting performance, giving precise information on the effect of throughput rate and input composition. The testing results can enter process optimization. With increasing throughput rates, product quantity rises following a saturation graph (despite exponential decrease in recovery). In the experiments a higher throughput rate also resulted in an exponential decrease of the yield while a change to the input composition had no such effect. The third evaluation criteria, product pu-rity, decreases linearly with increasing occupation density. The slope of this function depends on the input composition.},

In Europe and United States a reverse vending machine is a device that accepts used (empty) beverage containers and returns money to the user. In Russia we can provide the concept of automatic processing of plastic and metal waste combined with another mechanism for economic motivation of end users - system of discounts and bonuses in large trading networks. These machines have to be as cheap as possible but with rich functionality and security. Traditionally the basics of this machine is assembled with IoT controllers and tiny single-board computers which have heavy memory and computational restrictions. Nevertheless these controllers are able to recognize the waste types using cameras and provide sorting and some kind of preprocessing. We show our CNN implementation on IoT for reverse vending machine.},
